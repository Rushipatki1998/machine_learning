# Machine Learning Model Example

This example includes basic scripts for creating a machine learning model using Scikit-learn.

1. **preprocess.py**: Data preprocessing script (to be implemented).
2. **model.py**: A machine learning model using Scikit-learn.
3. **train.py**: A script where you should implement loading data, preprocessing, and training processes.
4. **evaluate.py**: A script to evaluate the trained model (to be implemented).
5. **predict.py**: A script to make predictions using the trained model (to be implemented).
6. **data_sample.csv**: A sample CSV data file.

## Usage

- Complete the `preprocess.py`, `train.py`, `evaluate.py`, and `predict.py` scripts as per your use case and data.
- Utilize `model.py` as a module in your training, evaluation, and prediction scripts.
- Replace `data_sample.csv` with your actual data for model training and testing.

## Note

Ensure to install necessary Python libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```
